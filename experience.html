        <h2>My Life</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in Bowling Green, Kentucky. After high school, I moved to Lexington, Kentucky where I managed a small, local coffee shop for years before going to massage therapy school. I took a college course in web design and I loved it. My first project was a (very basic) website for one of my favorite shows at the time, <em>Rescue Me.</em></p>
        <p>Years later I discovered Treehouse and decided to give it a go with a few courses here and there before I took the big plunge and signed up for techdegree.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I have one hobby that is a constant in my life, which is reading. Here are a few of my favorite books:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>The World According to Garp</li>
          <li>Practical Magic</li>
          <li>Lisey's Story</li>
          <li>Seven Years</li>
          <li>Illumination Night</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If I could get paid to sit around and read, I would probably take that job over anything in the world.</p>
