        <h2>My Life</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in Bowling Green, Kentucky. After high school, I moved to Lexington, Kentucky where I managed a small, local coffee shop for years before going to massage therapy school. I took a college course in web design and I loved it. My first project was a (very basic) website for one of my favorite shows at the time, <em>Rescue Me.</em></p>
        <p>Years later I discovered Treehouse and decided to give it a go with a few courses here and there before I took the big plunge and signed up for techdegree.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I aspire to keep practicing, failing (because sometimes it's necessary to fail in order to become a better learner), solving problems and finding solutions in the following areas:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I would love to learn enough to be able to take on remote positions in web development (wouldn't everyone?).</p>
